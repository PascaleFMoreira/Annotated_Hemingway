# Annotated_Hemingway

Hello there.

This repository holds the data for our papers "Comparing Transformer and Dictionary-based Sentiment Models for Literary Texts: Hemingway as a Case-study" for the NLP4DH2023 conference, and "Below the Sea (with the Sharks): Probing Textual Features of Implicit Sentiment in a Literary Case-study" - a short study of implicit sentiment expression for the Unimplicit workshop at EACL 2024.

In the data folder you'll find both raw and detrended versions of the human and machine annotation of the great work of art: The Old Man and the Sea.

You're cordially invited to go nuts.
